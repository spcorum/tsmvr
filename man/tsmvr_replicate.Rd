\value{
A list containing the \code{mean} and \code{sd} of the
error over the replicates as well as the means and standard
deviations of the errors across each fold.

\code{\link{tsmvr_cv}}, and \code{\link{tsmvr_solve}}.
}
\description{
Calculates the mean and standard deviation of fold-avereged errors
derived from replcated tsmvr k-fold cross-validation experiments.
The error for each base model is the normalized squared
error between the true response and the predicted response
on a given cross-validation set.
